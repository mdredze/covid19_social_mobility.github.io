## Computing Mobility
The Twitter Social Mobility Index is a measure of social distancing and travel derived from Twitter data. We use public geolocated Twitter data to measure how much a user travels in a given week.
We compute the standard deviation of Twitter geolocated tweets per week, 
and aggregate the data over an entire population to produce a metric for the US as a whole and for individual states and cities.

You can find a complete description of our method and results [in our paper](paper/twitter_social_mobility.pdf).

## Results
The highlights of our study find that:

* Since the start of social distancing on March 16, 2020 mobility in the United States has dropped 48.77%.
    
* Every US state and territory has reduced mobility, though the variance by state is high.

* States that were early adopters of social distancing practices have larger reductions in travel. The eight states that do not currently (April 5, 2020) have state wide orders rank lower: Arkansas (37), Iowa (50), Nebraska (29), North Dakota (13), South Carolina (34), South Dakota (39), Oklahoma (52), Utah (17),

* The last two weeks of March have the lowest mobility of any week since January 1, 2019.

 
## Mobility Reduction by State
This table shows the Twitter Social Mobility Index measured in kilometers for 
every state and territory in United States, New York City, and United States as a whole.
